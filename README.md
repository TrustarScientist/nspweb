VirtualSIM Backend API
This project is a backend API for a phone number generation, subscription, and SMS platform, built to demonstrate core backend development skills for international clients.

The API is built using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database. It handles secure user authentication, token management, and is ready for integration with a professional email service for user verification.

üöÄ Features
Secure User Authentication: Users can register and log in securely.

Flexible Login: Supports user login using either a username or email address.

Token-Based Authorization: Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to protect API routes.

User Email Verification: Implements a complete email verification flow to ensure user data integrity.

Email Sending Service: Integrated with SendGrid for reliable email delivery.

Dynamic API Endpoints: Protected routes are now more descriptive and logically organized.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Node.js: Asynchronous JavaScript runtime.

Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js.

MongoDB: NoSQL database for flexible data storage.

Mongoose: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.

Bcrypt: Used for secure password hashing.

JSON Web Token (JWT): For token-based authentication.

SendGrid: For professional email delivery.
